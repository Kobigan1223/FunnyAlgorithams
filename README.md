## Funny Algorithms

_A repository with a bunch of funny algorithms, beginners friendly :sparkles:_

_Don't forget to read our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/usj-foss/FunnyAlgorithams/edit/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/usj-foss/FunnyAlgorithams/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)_

## Algorithms are fun, right?

So why not add the funniest algorithms in this repository? We can share with all the world so people can have fun with us! 

You can contribute in two ways:

- Add a new algorithm inside a folder, name the folder with the type of the algorithm. Example: (Algorithm: bogoSort.c, folder: sort)
- Rewrite an existing algorithm in another programming language

It is always fun to check new algorithms or see how the same algorithms can be rewritten in different programming languages.
